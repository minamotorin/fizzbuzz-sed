FizzBuzz written in sed.

Usage
#####

::

  $ echo [number] | ./fizzbuzz.sed

Or without execute permission::

  $ echo [number] | /pass/to/sed -f ./fizzbuzz.sed

If your computer doesn't have echo, you can also do the following::

  $ ./fizzbuzz.sed
  [number]
  
Stand-alone version
*******************

::

  $ ./FizzBuzz_stand_alone

* Don't change the script file name
* Run in the same directory as the file

If you want to change the number of times, change the number of 4th line. Don't change other than numbers.

One-liner version
*****************

::

  $ ./oneliner.sed
  
You can run this program anywhere and you can change the file name to any one.

If you want to change the number of times, change ``100`` in the program (one place) to ``positive integer does not start with 0 what you want``. If your input is illegal, this program will quit with print ``Error``.

A limit of shebang
******************

The number of times of this program has limit because of a shebang limit. The maximam number you can use is ``999999999`` (I check it with only a shell I use). 

I could not add the future which print detailed error message because of a shebang limit.

TODO
  Minimal one-liner version

Two-liner version
*****************

::

  $ ./twoliner.sed
  
One-liner version has a limit because of a shebang limit. Two-liner version will solve this issue. Other description is same as the one-liner version:

You can run this program anywhere and you can change the file name to any one.

If you want to change the number of times, change ``100`` in 2nd line to ``positive integer does not start with 0 what you want``.

Dependencies
############

* sed

This program works with BSD sed, GNU sed, and POSIX sed.

This program works with BSD sed too, and it works fine now. But I recommend to use GNU sed for GNU extensions.

If you use macOS with `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_, you can install GNU sed as follows::

  $ brew install gsed

NOTE
****

I think this program dose not work with sed too old version because of limit of pattren space. But I cannot check it because I don't have sed old version.

This issue might be solved. See `issue #2 <https://github.com/minamotorin/FizzBuzz-sed/issues/2>`_.

TODO
  Version control tool for sed
  
Installation
############

Dependencies
************

* `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_
